Practicing Bootstrap..

I took the idea from the classes and the example from them. I tried to reproduce it using examples from the Bootstrap website. (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/)


# Technologies Used

The website was developed using the following technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS3 (including Flexbox for responsive layout)
- Bootstrap
